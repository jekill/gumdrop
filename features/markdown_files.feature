Feature: Markdown files
  In order to avoid messing around with HTML
  As a Gumdrop user
  I want Markdown files to be converted to HTML

  Scenario: My Markdown file is converted
#    Given I have my test site "test_site"
#    And It has a CSS file at "style/default.css"
#    When I generate my site in "destination_site"
#    Then I should have the CSS file in the destination folder
#    And Then delete the destination folder
